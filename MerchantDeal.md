# Merchant Deal System API Documentation

## üìã Overview

The Merchant Deal System provides functionality for merchant-to-merchant **fixed point deal exchange**. Merchants can create deals with fixed point amounts, discover other merchants' deals, and exchange points through a structured, no-negotiation process.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Fixed Point Deals**: Merchants create deals with fixed point amounts (no negotiation)
- **Point-Based Exchange**: 1 Rupee = 10 Points conversion rate
- **Deal Discovery**: Find deals from other merchants with merchant logos
- **Automatic Point Transfer**: Seamless point exchange when deals are completed
- **Location-Based Filtering**: Deals can be filtered by city and location
- **Deal Management**: Create, update, activate, deactivate deals
- **Real-time Notifications**: Instant notifications for deal activities
- **Point Tracking**: Complete audit trail of point usage
- **Merchant Logos**: Visual merchant identification in all API responses
- **Upfront Point Deduction**: Points are deducted immediately when deal is created
- **Filter-Based Actions**: Accept/reject requests using query parameters

## üîÑ Business Logic

### Fixed Point Deal System

The merchant deal system operates on a **fixed point model** where:

- **No Negotiation**: Points offered are fixed and cannot be negotiated
- **Take It or Leave It**: Merchants must accept the exact point amount offered
- **Automatic Assignment**: `points_requested` is automatically set to `deal.points_offered`
- **Simplified Process**: Eliminates complex counter-offer negotiations

    O --> P[Final State:<br/>A: 500 points<br/>B: 700 points]

    K --> Q[End: No transfer]
```

#### Phase 1: Deal Creation & Point Deduction

1. **Merchant A Creates Deal**:

   - Merchant A creates a deal with fixed points (e.g., 500 points)
   - Points are **immediately deducted** from Merchant A's wallet
   - Deal status becomes 'active'
   - Points are locked in the deal until completion or expiry

2. **Point Validation**:
   - System validates Merchant A has sufficient points in wallet
   - If insufficient, deal creation fails with error

#### Phase 2: Deal Discovery & Request

3. **Merchant B Discovers Deal**:

   - Merchant B browses available deals from other merchants
   - Can filter by category, location, points range
   - Sees merchant logos and deal details

4. **Merchant B Requests Deal**:
   - Merchant B requests to work on Merchant A's deal
   - `points_requested` is automatically set to `deal.points_offered` (500 points)
   - No negotiation allowed - fixed point system
   - Notification sent to Merchant A

#### Phase 3: Request Management

5. **Merchant A Reviews Request**:

   - Merchant A sees the request in their received requests
   - Can accept or reject the request
   - Only one request can be accepted per deal

6. **Accept Request (Auto-Rejection)**:
   - When Merchant A accepts a request, all other pending requests for the same deal are automatically rejected
   - Deal confirmation is created with status 'confirmed'
   - Deal points are marked as used (points_used += points_offered)
   - Notifications sent to all involved merchants

#### Phase 4: Deal Completion & Point Transfer

7. **Work Completion**:

   - Merchant B completes the work as per deal terms
   - Either merchant can trigger deal completion

8. **Point Transfer Execution**:

   - System creates `MerchantPointsTransfer` record
   - Points are **transferred from Merchant A to Merchant B**
   - **No additional deduction** - points move from locked state to requester
   - Transfer includes transaction ID and audit trail
   - Both wallets are updated atomically

9. **Deal Finalization**:
   - Deal status updated to 'completed'
   - `DealPointUsage` record created for audit
   - Notifications sent to both merchants
   - Transaction history updated

### Detailed Point Flow

#### Step-by-Step Point Movement:

```
1. Initial State:
   Merchant A Wallet: 1000 points
   Merchant B Wallet: 200 points

2. Deal Creation:
   Merchant A creates deal (500 points)
   Merchant A Wallet: 500 points (500 deducted)
   Deal Status: Active with 500 points locked

3. Deal Request & Acceptance:
   Merchant B requests deal
   Merchant A accepts request
   Deal Status: Confirmed (points still locked)

4. Deal Completion:
   Points transferred from Merchant A to Merchant B
   Merchant A Wallet: 500 points (no change - already deducted)
   Merchant B Wallet: 700 points (+500 received)
   Deal Status: Completed
   **Note**: No additional deduction - points just move from locked state to requester
```

#### Key Points:

- **Points are deducted upfront** when deal is created (not when completed)
- **Points are locked** in the deal until completion or expiry
- **No double deduction** - points only move once (from creator to requester)
- **No additional deduction on completion** - points just transfer from locked state
- **Atomic transfers** - either both wallets update or neither
- **Complete audit trail** - every transaction is tracked
- **Automatic notifications** - all parties are informed of status changes

### Error Handling & Edge Cases

#### Insufficient Points:

- Deal creation fails if merchant doesn't have enough points
- Clear error message with available vs required points

#### Deal Expiry:

- Expired deals cannot be requested
- Points remain locked until manual cleanup

#### Transfer Failures:

- If point transfer fails, deal remains in 'confirmed' status
- Retry mechanism available
- Complete rollback on failure

#### Multiple Requests:

- Only one request per deal per merchant allowed
- Accepting one request auto-rejects all others
- Prevents conflicts and confusion

## üíº Use Cases

### For Merchants

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Error Handling

### Common Error Responses

#### 400 Bad Request

```json
{
  "error": "Insufficient points in wallet",
  "status": 400
}
```

```json
{
  "error": "You cannot request your own deal",
  "status": 400
}
```

#### 401 Unauthorized

```json
{
  "error": "Authentication required",
  "status": 401
}
```

#### 403 Forbidden

```json
{
  "error": "Merchant access required",
  "status": 403
}
```

#### 404 Not Found

```json
{
  "error": "Deal not found",

}
```

#### 409 Conflict

  "error": "Deal request already exists",
  "status": 409
}
```

## üñºÔ∏è Merchant Logo Integration

### Logo Display in API Responses

All deal-related API responses now include merchant logos for better visual identification:

- **Deal Lists**: Shows merchant logo for each deal
- **Deal Requests**: Shows both requesting merchant and deal creator logos
- **Deal Confirmations**: Shows both merchant logos involved
- **Deal Discovery**: Shows merchant logos in search results

### Logo URL Format

```json
{
  "merchant_logo": "http://localhost:8000/media/merchant/logo/merchant_logo.jpg"
}
```

### Logo Handling

- **Safe Context Access**: Handles cases where request context might not be available
- **Fallback URLs**: Returns relative URLs if absolute URLs can't be generated
- **Null Handling**: Returns `null` if merchant has no logo
- **No Breaking Changes**: Existing API functionality remains unchanged

## üîí Security Considerations

1. **Authentication**: All endpoints require JWT token authentication
2. **Authorization**: Merchants can only access their own data
3. **Point Validation**: System validates sufficient points before deal creation
4. **Data Validation**: All input data is validated and sanitized
5. **Atomic Transactions**: All point transfers are atomic and secure
6. **Audit Trail**: Complete transaction history is maintained
7. **Fixed Point Security**: No point manipulation through negotiation
8. **Upfront Deduction**: Points are deducted immediately to prevent double-spending
9. **Transfer Integrity**: Point transfers are atomic - either both wallets update or neither
10. **Transaction IDs**: Every transaction has a unique ID for tracking and debugging

## üí∞ Point Transfer Mechanism

### How Points Move in the System

The merchant deal system uses a **two-phase point transfer**:

#### Phase 1: Deal Creation (Immediate Deduction)

- Points are **immediately deducted** from creator's wallet
- Points are **locked** in the deal until completion
- Prevents double-spending and ensures commitment

#### Phase 2: Deal Completion (Transfer to Requester)

- Points are **transferred** from creator to requester
- No additional deduction - points just move from locked state to requester
- Atomic operation ensures data consistency

## üìã Complete Merchant-to-Merchant Flow Summary

### The Complete Journey

1. **Merchant A** creates a deal with 500 points ‚Üí **Points immediately deducted from A's wallet**
2. **Merchant B** discovers the deal and requests to work on it ‚Üí **Notification sent to A**
3. **Merchant A** accepts the request ‚Üí **All other requests auto-rejected, deal confirmed, points marked as used**
4. **Merchant B** completes the work ‚Üí **Either merchant can trigger completion**
5. **System** transfers 500 points from A to B ‚Üí **No additional deduction, deal marked as completed**

### Key Points to Remember

- **No Double Deduction**: Points are deducted once (at creation) and transferred once (at completion)
- **Immediate Commitment**: Points are locked when deal is created
- **No Additional Deduction**: Points just move from locked state to requester on completion
- **Atomic Operations**: All transfers are atomic and secure
- **Complete Tracking**: Every transaction is recorded and auditable
- **Fixed System**: No negotiation - take it or leave it
- **Auto-Management**: System handles rejections and notifications automatically

### What Makes This System Special

- **Prevents Double-Spending**: Points are deducted upfront
- **Ensures Commitment**: Deal creator can't back out after points are locked
- **Simplifies Process**: No complex negotiation or counter-offers
- **Maintains Integrity**: Atomic transfers prevent data corruption
- **Provides Transparency**: Complete audit trail for all transactions
- **Scales Efficiently**: Fixed point system reduces complexity

## üîß Current API Structure

The merchant deal system uses a **clean API design** with separate endpoints for different functionalities:

### API Endpoint Structure

#### Deal Management

- **Merchant Deals**: `/api/custom_auth/v1/merchant-deals/` - CRUD operations for deals
- **Deal Discovery**: `/api/custom_auth/v1/deal-discovery/` - Discover deals from other merchants

#### Request Management

- **Deal Requests**: `/api/custom_auth/v1/merchant-deal-requests/` - Requests made BY current merchant

### Filter-Based Actions

The system uses **filter-based actions** for request management:

#### How It Works

Use query parameters to perform actions on requests:

```http
# List received requests
GET /api/custom_auth/v1/received-requests/

# Accept request ID 123 (auto-rejects others for same deal)
GET /api/custom_auth/v1/received-requests/?action=accept&request_id=123

# Reject request ID 456
GET /api/custom_auth/v1/received-requests/?action=reject&request_id=456
```

#### Benefits

- **Simplified API** - Actions integrated with listing
- **Consistent Interface** - Same pattern for both request types
- **Flexible Filtering** - Combine actions with other filters
- **Auto-Rejection** - Automatically rejects other requests when accepting one
- **Easy Integration** - Simple query parameter approach
