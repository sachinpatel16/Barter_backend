## üîÑ Updated Merchant-to-Merchant Deal Flow

### Current Implementation Flow

The merchant deal system now operates with a **single deduction model** where points are deducted once at creation and automatically transferred upon acceptance:

#### **Phase 1: Deal Creation**

1. **Merchant A** creates a deal with 500 points
2. **Points are immediately deducted** from Merchant A's wallet (500 points)
3. Deal status becomes 'active' with points locked
4. Deal is visible to other merchants for discovery

#### **Phase 2: Deal Request & Acceptance (Automatic Completion)**

5. **Merchant B** discovers the deal and requests to work on it
6. **Merchant A** accepts the request
7. All other pending requests for the same deal are automatically rejected
8. Deal confirmation is created with status 'confirmed'
9. **Points are automatically transferred** from Merchant A to Merchant B
10. Deal confirmation status becomes 'completed'
11. Both merchants receive notifications about the completed transfer
12. Deal points are marked as used and transferred
13. Complete audit trail created

### **Final Point Distribution:**

- **Merchant A**: 0 points (500 deducted at deal creation)
- **Merchant B**: 700 points (200 original + 500 received from deal)
- **Total System Points**: 700 points (500 points effectively "consumed" by the deal)

### **Key Differences from Previous Documentation:**

- ‚ùå **Removed**: Activate/Deactivate deal functionality
- ‚ùå **Removed**: Deal statistics API
- ‚ùå **Removed**: Manual deal completion API
- ‚úÖ **Added**: Deal deletion with automatic point refunds
- ‚úÖ **Updated**: Single deduction system with automatic transfer
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced**: Automatic deal completion upon acceptance
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced**: Comprehensive error handling for all operations

### Fixed Point Deal System

The merchant deal system operates on a **fixed point model** where:

- **No Negotiation**: Points offered are fixed and cannot be negotiated
- **Take It or Leave It**: Merchants must accept the exact point amount offered
- **Automatic Assignment**: `points_requested` is automatically set to `deal.points_offered`
- **Simplified Process**: Eliminates complex counter-offer negotiations

### Complete Merchant-to-Merchant Flow

#### Visual Flow Diagram

    L --> M[Final State:<br/>A: 0 points<br/>B: 700 points]

    K --> Q[End: No transfer]
```

#### Phase 1: Deal Creation & Point Deduction

1. **Merchant A Creates Deal**:

   - Merchant A creates a deal with fixed points (e.g., 500 points)
   - Points are **immediately deducted** from Merchant A's wallet
   - Deal status becomes 'active'
   - Points are locked in the deal until completion or expiry

2. **Point Validation**:
   - System validates Merchant A has sufficient points in wallet
   - If insufficient, deal creation fails with error

#### Phase 2: Deal Discovery & Request

3. **Merchant B Discovers Deal**:

   - Merchant B browses available deals from other merchants
   - Can filter by category, location, points range
   - Sees merchant logos and deal details

4. **Merchant B Requests Deal**:
   - Merchant B requests to work on Merchant A's deal
   - `points_requested` is automatically set to `deal.points_offered` (500 points)
   - No negotiation allowed - fixed point system
   - Notification sent to Merchant A

#### Phase 3: Request Management

5. **Merchant A Reviews Request**:

   - Merchant A sees the request in their received requests
   - Can accept or reject the request
   - Only one request can be accepted per deal

6. **Accept Request (Automatic Completion)**:
   - When Merchant A accepts a request, all other pending requests for the same deal are automatically rejected
   - Deal confirmation is created with status 'confirmed'
   - **Points are automatically transferred** from Merchant A to Merchant B
   - Deal confirmation status becomes 'completed'
   - `MerchantPointsTransfer` record created with transaction ID
   - `DealPointUsage` record created for audit
   - Notifications sent to all involved merchants
   - Complete audit trail created

### Detailed Point Flow

#### Step-by-Step Point Movement:

```
1. Initial State:
   Merchant A Wallet: 1000 points
   Merchant B Wallet: 200 points

2. Deal Creation:
   Merchant A creates deal (500 points)
   Merchant A Wallet: 500 points (500 deducted)
   Deal Status: Active with 500 points locked

3. Deal Request & Acceptance (Automatic Transfer):
   Merchant B requests deal
   Merchant A accepts request
   Points automatically transferred from A to B
   Merchant A Wallet: 0 points (500 transferred)
   Merchant B Wallet: 700 points (200 + 500 received)
   Deal Status: Completed
   **Note**: Single transfer occurs - points move from A to B upon acceptance
```

#### Key Points:

- **Points are deducted upfront** when deal is created
- **Points are locked** in the deal until acceptance
- **Single transfer occurs** - points transferred from creator to requester upon acceptance
- **Automatic completion** - no manual completion step required
- **Atomic transfers** - either both wallets update or neither
- **Complete audit trail** - every transaction is tracked
- **Automatic notifications** - all parties are informed of status changes

### Error Handling & Edge Cases

#### Insufficient Points:

- Deal creation fails if merchant doesn't have enough points
- Clear error message with available vs required points

#### Deal Expiry:

- Expired deals cannot be requested
- Points remain locked until manual cleanup

#### Transfer Failures:

- If point transfer fails, deal remains in 'confirmed' status
- Retry mechanism available
- Complete rollback on failure

#### Multiple Requests:

- Only one request per deal per merchant allowed
- Accepting one request auto-rejects all others

## üñºÔ∏è Merchant Logo Integration

### Logo Display in API Responses

All deal-related API responses now include merchant logos for better visual identification:

- **Deal Lists**: Shows merchant logo for each deal
- **Deal Requests**: Shows both requesting merchant and deal creator logos
- **Deal Confirmations**: Shows both merchant logos involved
- **Deal Discovery**: Shows merchant logos in search results

### Logo URL Format

```json
{
  "merchant_logo": "http://localhost:8000/media/merchant/logo/merchant_logo.jpg"
}
```

### Logo Handling

- **Safe Context Access**: Handles cases where request context might not be available
- **Fallback URLs**: Returns relative URLs if absolute URLs can't be generated
- **Null Handling**: Returns `null` if merchant has no logo
- **No Breaking Changes**: Existing API functionality remains unchanged

## üîí Security Considerations

1. **Authentication**: All endpoints require JWT token authentication
2. **Authorization**: Merchants can only access their own data
3. **Point Validation**: System validates sufficient points before deal creation
4. **Data Validation**: All input data is validated and sanitized
5. **Atomic Transactions**: All point transfers are atomic and secure
6. **Audit Trail**: Complete transaction history is maintained
7. **Fixed Point Security**: No point manipulation through negotiation
8. **Upfront Deduction**: Points are deducted immediately to prevent double-spending
9. **Transfer Integrity**: Point transfers are atomic - either both wallets update or neither
10. **Transaction IDs**: Every transaction has a unique ID for tracking and debugging

## üí∞ Point Transfer Mechanism

### How Points Move in the System

The merchant deal system uses a **two-phase point transfer**:

#### Phase 1: Deal Creation (Immediate Deduction)

- Points are **immediately deducted** from creator's wallet
- Points are **locked** in the deal until completion
- Prevents double-spending and ensures commitment

#### Phase 2: Deal Completion (Transfer to Requester)

- Points are **transferred** from creator to requester
- No additional deduction - points just move from locked state to requester
- Atomic operation ensures data consistency

### Point Transfer Models

#### MerchantPointsTransfer Model

```python
{
    "confirmation": "DealConfirmation ID",
    "from_merchant": "Merchant A (creator)",
    "to_merchant": "Merchant B (requester)",
    "points_amount": 500.0,
    "transfer_fee": 0.00,
    "net_amount": 500.0,
    "status": "completed",
    "transaction_id": "TRF_ABC12345"
}
```

#### DealPointUsage Model

```python
{
    "deal": "Deal ID",
    "confirmation": "Confirmation ID",
    "from_merchant": "Merchant A",
    "to_merchant": "Merchant B",
    "usage_type": "exchange",
    "points_used": 500.0,
    "transaction_id": "DEAL_USAGE_XYZ67890"
}
```

### Wallet Integration

The system integrates with the existing wallet system:

- **Wallet.deduct_points()**: Deducts points and creates history
- **Wallet.add_points()**: Adds points and creates history
- **WalletHistory**: Tracks all point movements
- **Transaction IDs**: Links all related transactions

## üìä Integration Points

## üîß Current API Structure

The merchant deal system uses a **clean API design** with separate endpoints for different functionalities:

### API Endpoint Structure

#### Deal Management

- **Merchant Deals**: `/api/custom_auth/v1/merchant-deals/` - CRUD operations for deals
- **Deal Discovery**: `/api/custom_auth/v1/deal-discovery/` - Discover deals from other merchants

#### Request Management

- **Deal Requests**: `/api/custom_auth/v1/merchant-deal-requests/` - Requests made BY current merchant
- **Received Requests**: `/api/custom_auth/v1/received-requests/` - Requests received FOR current merchant's deals

#### Deal Processing

- **Deal Confirmations**: `/api/custom_auth/v1/deal-confirmations/` - Confirmed deals and completion
- **Notifications**: `/api/custom_auth/v1/merchant-notifications/` - Merchant notifications

### Filter-Based Actions

The system uses **filter-based actions** for request management:

#### How It Works

Use query parameters to perform actions on requests:

```http
# List received requests
GET /api/custom_auth/v1/received-requests/

# Accept request ID 123 (auto-rejects others for same deal)
GET /api/custom_auth/v1/received-requests/?action=accept&request_id=123

# Reject request ID 456
GET /api/custom_auth/v1/received-requests/?action=reject&request_id=456

# Alternative: POST endpoints for accept/reject
POST /api/custom_auth/v1/merchant-deal-requests/123/accept/
POST /api/custom_auth/v1/merchant-deal-requests/456/reject/
```

#### Benefits

- **Simplified API** - Actions integrated with listing
- **Consistent Interface** - Same pattern for both request types
- **Flexible Filtering** - Combine actions with other filters
- **Auto-Rejection** - Automatically rejects other requests when accepting one
- **Easy Integration** - Simple query parameter approach

#### Available Actions

**Filter-Based Actions (Recommended):**

- `action=accept` - Accept a specific request (auto-rejects others for same deal)
- `action=reject` - Reject a specific request
- `status=pending` - Filter by pending requests
- `deal__category=1` - Filter by deal category
- `points_requested=500` - Filter by points requested

**Alternative POST Endpoints:**

- `POST /api/custom_auth/v1/merchant-deal-requests/{id}/accept/` - Accept request
- `POST /api/custom_auth/v1/merchant-deal-requests/{id}/reject/` - Reject request

#### Two Methods for Accept/Reject

**Method 1: Filter-Based Actions (Recommended)**

```http
